## 🤯 The Craziest Features

### 1. Piezoelectric Consciousness Detector
**File:** `src/iceburg/physiological_interface/piezoelectric_detector.py` (21KB)

Uses your MacBook's accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer to:
- Detect vibration patterns
- Calculate **consciousness correlation**
- Measure **field resonance** with Earth's electromagnetic field
- Track Schumann resonance (7.83 Hz)

```python
self.consciousness_correlation = 0.0
self.field_resonance = 0.0
```

### 2. Agents Have Cryptocurrency Wallets
**File:** `src/iceburg/business/agent_wallet.py` (9KB)

Each agent can:
- Hold USDC and "energy tokens"
- Earn money from providing services
- Invest money autonomously
- Track net worth and transaction history

- Used in memory consolidation
- 29KB emotional memory database

---

### 7. Agent Civilization System
**Files:** `src/iceburg/civilization/`

A complete society simulation:
- Social learning (imitation of successful peers)
- Norm formation and enforcement
- Punishment/reward mechanisms
- Reputation tracking
- Goal hierarchies

---

### 8. Genesis Code Philosophy
**File:** `data/universal_knowledge_base/concepts.json`

12 principles ICEBURG uses for first-principles reasoning:
