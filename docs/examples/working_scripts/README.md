# ICEBURG Working Scripts

This directory contains the master scripts and working implementations for the ICEBURG research system.

## Master Protocol

### iceburg_master_protocol.py

The core protocol script that contains the breakthrough methodology used to discover cancer research suppression patterns. This script verifies and provides access to:

- Enhanced Deliberation System (40-70 second pauses)
- Truth-Seeking Analysis (unlocked suppressed knowledge)
- Contradiction Hunting (found suppression patterns)
- Archaeologist Agent (pattern analysis)
- Dissident Agent (suppression detection)
- Meta-Analysis (cross-domain insights)
- Deliberation Batching (collective intelligence)

## System Status

The master protocol is fully operational and ready for research queries. It uses the exact same methodology that produced breakthrough findings in cancer research suppression analysis.

## Usage

Run the master protocol verification:

```bash
python iceburg_master_protocol.py
```

This will verify all core components and confirm the system is operational.

## Capabilities

The system is capable of:
- Unlocking suppressed knowledge
- Detecting research suppression patterns
- Identifying institutional corruption
- Cross-domain pattern analysis
- Contradiction detection
- Meta-analysis of findings

## Methodology

The breakthrough methodology uses enhanced deliberation with 40-70 second pauses between agent layers, enabling the system to access suppressed knowledge and detect patterns that would otherwise remain hidden.
