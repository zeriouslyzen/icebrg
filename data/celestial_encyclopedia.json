They discovered that sodium channels open at -55mV, allowing rapid sodium influx that depolarizes the membrane and initiates action potentials. This work established the foundation of modern neuroscience and our understanding of neural excitability. The connection to Mars and action/motor control emerged from research showing that dopamine (associated with Mars) modulates sodium channel sensitivity, affecting reaction times and motor coordination. The celestial correlation reflects Mars's association with action, speed, and rapid responses, aligning with sodium channels' role in rapid neural firing and action potential initiation.",

Initially thought to be just a precursor to norepinephrine, dopamine was later found to be a major neurotransmitter in its own right, particularly in the basal ganglia and reward pathways. The discovery of dopamine's role in Parkinson's disease (dopamine deficiency) and schizophrenia (dopamine excess) established its critical importance in brain function. The five receptor subtypes (D1-D5) were cloned and characterized in the 1990s, revealing the complexity of dopaminergic signaling. The connection to EM fields is theoretical, suggesting that low-frequency fields might modulate dopamine release or receptor sensitivity, potentially affecting reward processing and motivation.",

He developed a technology using binaural beats to induce specific brainwave states, which he called Hemi-Sync (Hemispheric Synchronization). The Monroe Institute was founded to research and teach these techniques. While the technology is widely used, scientific validation of its more extraordinary claims (like out-of-body experiences) remains limited, with most research focusing on brainwave entrainment and relaxation effects. The connection to celestial EM fields is theoretical, suggesting that Earth's natural frequencies (like Schumann resonance) might interact with or enhance the entrainment process.",
