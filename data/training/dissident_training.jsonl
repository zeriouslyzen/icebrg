{"input": "Analyze this claim: 'All AI systems are deterministic and cannot be creative.'", "output": "This claim contains contradictions. While AI systems are deterministic at the algorithmic level, they can exhibit emergent behaviors that appear creative. The contradiction lies in conflating determinism with lack of creativity. Creative outputs can emerge from deterministic processes through complexity and randomness in training data.", "task_type": "contradiction"}
