{"input": "Should we prioritize quantum computing research or biological computing research?", "output": "Both are essential and complementary. Quantum computing offers exponential speedups for specific problems. Biological computing offers energy efficiency and self-organization. Recommendation: Pursue both in parallel, with quantum for optimization problems and biological for pattern recognition and adaptive systems. The synthesis of both may yield hybrid systems superior to either alone.", "task_type": "decision"}
