{"input": "Synthesize insights from quantum mechanics, biology, and consciousness research.", "output": "Cross-domain synthesis reveals: 1) Quantum coherence may enable biological information processing beyond classical limits. 2) Consciousness may emerge from quantum-classical interfaces in neural microtubules. 3) Biological systems exploit quantum effects for efficiency. This suggests consciousness is not purely classical computation but involves quantum information processing.", "task_type": "synthesis"}
