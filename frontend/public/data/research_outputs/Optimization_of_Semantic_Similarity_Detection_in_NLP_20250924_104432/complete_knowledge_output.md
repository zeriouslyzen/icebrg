# RESEARCH ABSTRACT

**Title**: Optimization of Semantic Similarity Detection in NLP: A Cross-Domain Theoretical Framework

**Abstract**:
To enhance the accuracy and efficiency of semantic similarity detection algorithms, a multifaceted approach that revises current conservative methods by incorporating transfer learning with domain-specific embeddings, simplifies out-of-vocabulary word handling techniques, combines machine learning with rule-based systems where beneficial, and conducts comparative studies is recommended. This research presents a novel theoretical framework that integrates insights from 1 distinct domains: Natural Language Processing. Through systematic analysis and cross-domain synthesis, we identify emergent properties that transcend individual domain boundaries. Our findings suggest that optimization of semantic similarity detection in nlp represents a fundamental pattern in knowledge organization and reality perception. The framework provides a foundation for future research in cross-domain integration and emergent knowledge synthesis.
