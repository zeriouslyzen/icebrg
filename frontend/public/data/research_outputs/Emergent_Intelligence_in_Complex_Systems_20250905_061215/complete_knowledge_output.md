# RESEARCH ABSTRACT

**Title**: Emergent Intelligence in Complex Systems: A Cross-Domain Theoretical Framework

**Abstract**:
Complex systems, including those that combine human creativity with AI's pattern recognition abilities and adaptable frameworks for science and technology design, can exhibit emergent intelligence leading to unpredictable outcomes. This research presents a novel theoretical framework that integrates insights from 2 distinct domains: Biology, Artificial Intelligence. Through systematic analysis and cross-domain synthesis, we identify emergent properties that transcend individual domain boundaries. Our findings suggest that emergent intelligence in complex systems represents a fundamental pattern in knowledge organization and reality perception. The framework provides a foundation for future research in cross-domain integration and emergent knowledge synthesis.

**Keywords**: emergent intelligence in complex systems, cross-domain integration, emergent properties, knowledge synthesis, theoretical framework

**Domain Coverage**: Biology, Artificial Intelligence

**Research Significance**: This work establishes a new paradigm for understanding how knowledge domains interact and generate emergent insights that cannot be derived from single-domain analysis alone.
