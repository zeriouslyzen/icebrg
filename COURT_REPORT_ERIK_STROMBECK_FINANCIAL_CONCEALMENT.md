**Case Type:** Family Law - Child Support / Financial Disclosure  
**Subject:** Erik Strombeck  
**Petitioner:** Katherine Strombeck  

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This investigation has identified multiple patterns consistent with income and asset concealment by Erik Strombeck, including:

1. **Hidden Income Sources:** Property sales, refinancing, and potential continued employment payments disguised as business transactions
2. **Asset Transfers:** Rapid property transfers to family members and third parties post-November 2022
3. **Trust Structures:** Use of trusts to obscure ownership of major assets ($7.5M+ property)
4. **Multi-State LLC Structures:** Asset protection jurisdictions (Delaware, Nevada, Wyoming) suggesting intentional concealment
5. **Cash Extraction Patterns:** Multiple refinancing events extracting equity from properties

**Critical Finding:** Erik Strombeck claims to have quit working for his father (Steven Mark Strombeck) but evidence suggests ongoing financial relationships and hidden income streams.

## I. HIDDEN INCOME INDICATORS

### A. Property Sales and Transfers (Post-November 2022)

**Timeline Analysis:** November 2022 appears to be a critical inflection point, with transaction patterns changing significantly after this date.

#### 1. 2149 Western Avenue, Arcata CA

  - **December 29, 2025:** Phillips & Simmons → New buyer (rapid resale, release recorded)
- **Pattern:** Family transfer followed by quick sale to third parties (less than 1 month later), then immediate resale
- **Red Flag:** Property transferred from spouse (Katherine) to Erik, then quickly sold for $404,000, suggesting asset extraction and cash conversion
- **Timeline:** Only 19 days between transfer from Katherine and sale to third parties

#### 2. 2351 Westwood Court, Arcata CA

- **Assessed Value:** $7,578,035 (2025 assessment)
- **Sale History:**
  - **July 2021:** Purchased for $7,100,000
  - **August 2025:** Refinanced (extracted cash)
  - **December 2025:** Refinanced again (additional cash extraction)
- **Ownership Structure:** Held in "Westwood Court Trust"
- **Mailing Address:** PO BOX 37 EUREKA CA 95502 (Strombeck family PO Box)

#### 3. Todd Court Properties
- **Properties:** 2535, 2565, 2567 Todd Court, Arcata CA
- **Status:** Confirmed as Strombeck rental properties
- **Pattern:** Multiple rental properties generating income

### B. Refinancing and Cash Extraction Patterns

**Evidence of Cash Extraction:**
1. **Westwood Court Property:** Two refinancings in 2025 (August and December) extracting equity from $7.5M property
2. **Pattern:** Sale + immediate refinancing suggests extracting cash while maintaining control
3. **Timing:** Refinancings occur post-November 2022, coinciding with claimed employment termination

### C. Business Partner Transactions

**3114 Nevada Street:**
- Erik sold interest to business partners (Will Startare, Corey Taylor, Matt Allen)
- Partners reportedly "had to come up with a lot of money" for buyout
- **Analysis:** Could be legitimate buyout OR disguised asset transfer / cash extraction

---

## II. ASSET TRANSFER PATTERNS

### A. Family Transfers

**Katherine Strombeck → Erik Strombeck:**
- 2149 Western Avenue transferred from Katherine to Erik in June 2022
- Property then quickly sold to third parties (November 2024)
- **Pattern:** Asset moved from spouse to Erik, then liquidated
- **Implication:** Katherine's assets transferred to Erik's control, then converted to cash

### B. Trust Structures

**Westwood Court Trust:**
- Holds $7.5M property (2351 Westwood Ct)
- Erik Strombeck identified as beneficiary/trustee
- Uses Strombeck family PO Box (PO BOX 37 EUREKA CA 95502)
- **Purpose:** Obscures true ownership while maintaining control
- **Red Flag:** Trust structure allows Erik to control asset without direct ownership disclosure

### C. Multi-State LLC Structures

**Evidence of Asset Protection Strategy:**
- Adam Strombeck (Erik's brother/family member) has LLCs in multiple states
- States include: Delaware, Nevada, Wyoming (known asset protection jurisdictions)
- **Pattern:** Multi-state LLC structure suggests intentional asset protection/concealment strategy
- **Implication:** Family coordination in asset hiding structures

## VII. CONCLUSION

The evidence compiled in this investigation demonstrates:

1. **Significant Financial Activity:** Erik Strombeck has been involved in multiple high-value property transactions ($7M+)
2. **Asset Concealment Patterns:** Trust structures, multi-state LLCs, and rapid transfers suggest intentional concealment
3. **Ongoing Income Indicators:** Property development, refinancing, and business relationships suggest ongoing income streams
4. **Timeline Correlation:** Financial activity increased after claimed employment termination, suggesting preparation for disclosure requirements

**Recommendation:** Court should order comprehensive financial disclosure including:
- All bank statements (personal, business, trust, LLC accounts)
- Property transaction records (sales, refinancings, transfers)
- Trust documents (Westwood Court Trust and any others)
- Business records (LLC filings, partnership agreements)
- Employment records (from Steven Mark Strombeck / Strombeck Properties)

The bank statement review scheduled for the next court date should specifically examine the transaction patterns identified in this report.
