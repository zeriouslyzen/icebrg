## INVESTIGATION IMPLICATIONS

### Why Different States?

1. **Asset Protection**
   - Delaware, Wyoming, Nevada offer strongest creditor protection
   - Charging order protection limits creditor access to LLC assets
   - Privacy protections obscure true ownership

2. **Legal Separation**
   - Different states create legal separation between entities
   - Makes it harder to trace asset ownership
   - Creates jurisdictional complexity for creditors

3. **Tax Optimization**
   - Different states may offer tax advantages
   - Can optimize tax structure across states
   - May reduce overall tax liability

4. **Operational Flexibility**
   - California LLCs for local operations
   - Out-of-state LLCs for asset holding
   - Maintains operational presence while protecting assets

### Red Flags

⚠️ **LLC registered in Delaware** - Asset protection jurisdiction  
⚠️ **LLC registered in Wyoming** - Asset protection jurisdiction  
⚠️ **LLC registered in Nevada** - Asset protection jurisdiction  
⚠️ **Dual-state structure** - California operations + out-of-state asset protection  
⚠️ **Family coordination** - Both Adam and Erik using same strategy  
⚠️ **Multiple jurisdictions** - 7 states suggests sophisticated planning

## CONNECTION TO EXISTING INVESTIGATION

### Timeline Correlation
