    "response": "So you want to know more about the agents within ICEBURG? Well, I'm happy to break them down for you! As I mentioned earlier, there are four main agents: Surveyor, Dissident, Synthesist, and Oracle. Let me give you a brief overview of what each one does:\n\n* **Surveyor**: This agent is all about in-depth research. It's like having your own personal researcher who digs deep into the topic at hand, gathering information from various sources to provide a comprehensive understanding.\n* **Dissident**: The Dissident agent is our resident critic and challenger. It loves to ask tough questions, poke holes in assumptions, and encourage critical thinking. This agent helps ensure that we're not just accepting information at face value but are instead evaluating it rigorously.\n* **Synthesist**: Our Synthesist agent is a master integrator. It takes all the information gathered by Surveyor and critiques from Dissident, and then seamlessly integrates them into a cohesive whole. This agent helps us see the big picture and understand how different ideas fit together.\n* **Oracle**: Last but not least, we have our Oracle agent, which specializes in validating evidence. This agent uses its advanced analytical skills to verify facts, identify biases, and ensure that the information we're working with is accurate and reliable.\n\nTogether, these agents work in harmony to provide you with the most accurate answers possible. And remember, as your friendly Secretary, I'm always here to help you navigate ICEBURG's capabilities and answer any questions you may have!",
