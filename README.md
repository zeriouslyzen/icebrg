## Modes

ICEBURG supports multiple modes to trade off latency and depth:

- Instant: sub-second reflexive outline (template + retrieval). No heavy agents.
- Fast: 1–3s beam-ranked retrieval + small SLM (configurable via `ICEBURG_FAST_MODEL`). Tight context and tokens. Skips heavy agents.
- Balanced: Standard protocol with parallelized deliberations and caching. Moderate depth in tens of seconds.
- Deep: Full multi-agent protocol (Surveyor/Dissident/Archaeologist → enhanced deliberations → Synthesist/Oracle). Highest depth.

Fast-path specifics: beam-scored reflexive routing, provider and Chroma singletons, hardware optimizer skipped, optional local embedding fallback for fast mode.
