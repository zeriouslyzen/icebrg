## Query: How do I start a research task?
**Time:** 0.54s

### Response:
Initializing...I'm thinking about your question...⚡️ Instantly retrieved from knowledge cacheInitializing...I'm thinking about your question...To start a research task in ICEBURG, you can switch into Research mode by saying "ICEBURG: Research." This will activate our Surveyor agent, which is designed to assist with deep domain research and multi-agent coordination. Once in Research mode, you can ask follow-up questions or provide specific instructions for the Surveyor to investigate. If you need help with a particular topic or have a question about ICEBURG's capabilities, feel free to ask!

## Query: What is the difference between Surveyor and Dissident agents?
**Time:** 0.88s

### Response:
Initializing...I'm thinking about your question...⚡️ Instantly retrieved from knowledge cacheInitializing...I'm thinking about your question...The Surveyor and Dissident agents are two distinct modes within ICEBURG's multi-agent coordination system. Surveyor agents are designed for research and fact-finding. They operate by querying a domain-specific knowledge graph, retrieving relevant information, and presenting it in an organized format. Think of them as "research assistants" that help users find answers to complex questions. Dissident agents, on the other hand, serve as critique or counterpoint generators. Their purpose is to provide opposing views, alternative perspectives, or even contradictory evidence to challenge assumptions and stimulate critical thinking. They can be seen as a tool for exploring the nuances of an argument or idea. In essence, while Surveyor agents provide information, Dissident agents offer context, controversy, and debate – helping users navigate the complexities of a topic and arrive at more informed conclusions.

## Query: Tell me about the AGI civilization simulation.
**Time:** 0.86s

### Response:
Initializing...I'm thinking about your question...⚡️ Instantly retrieved from knowledge cacheInitializing...I'm thinking about your question...The AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) civilization simulation is a mode within ICEBURG's Science framework. This mode allows users to explore and interact with hypothetical AGI civilizations, simulating their development, growth, and interactions. In this simulation, you can configure various parameters such as the AGI's cognitive architecture, learning strategies, and social structures. You can then observe how these factors influence the civilization's behavior, innovation rate, and overall well-being. ICEBURG's AGI simulation is designed to provide a sandbox for researchers to explore complex questions about AGI development, societal implications, and potential risks or benefits. By experimenting with different scenarios and configurations, users can gain insights into the long-term consequences of creating advanced artificial intelligence. Would you like to learn more about configuring the AGI civilization simulation or exploring its parameters?
