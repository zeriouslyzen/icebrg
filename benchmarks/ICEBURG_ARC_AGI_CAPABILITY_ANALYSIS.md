## RECOMMENDATIONS

### For Benchmark Accuracy:
1. **Use ICEBURG for what it's good at**: Pattern recognition, emergence, multi-step reasoning
2. **Expect lower scores** on spatial reasoning and formal logic tasks
3. **Interpret results contextually**: ICEBURG is research-focused, not puzzle-solving focused

### For Improving ARC-AGI Performance:
1. **Add spatial reasoning module**: For hierarchical/containment logic
2. **Enhance formal logic capabilities**: For transformation rules
3. **Add compositional reasoning**: For formal compositional patterns
4. **Keep existing strengths**: Pattern recognition, emergence detection, multi-step reasoning

## CONCLUSION

**ICEBURG has PARTIAL capability** for ARC-AGI benchmarks:

- ✅ **Strong**: Pattern recognition, emergence detection, multi-step reasoning, counterfactual reasoning
- ⚠️ **Partial**: Abstract transformations, analogical reasoning, compositional reasoning, hierarchical reasoning
- ❌ **Weak**: Spatial reasoning

**Expected Performance**: 
- High scores (70-90%) on tasks requiring pattern recognition, emergence detection, multi-step reasoning
